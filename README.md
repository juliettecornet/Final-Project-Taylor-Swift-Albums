# Final Project - Juliette Cornet
## Taylor Swift Albums Analysis 

This repository contains the notebook for my final project, a requirements.txt file for Binder containing all the libraries I've imported and this Readme markdown file. 

In my final prject, I use a combination of data science and textual analysis to better understand Taylor Swift's lyrics throughout her albums. By looking at word and noun frequency as well as sentiment analysis, I attempt to identify shifts in her tone and commons themes in her lyrics to see whether these shifts concidide with her changing public persona.
